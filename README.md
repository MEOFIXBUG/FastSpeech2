# FastSpeech 2 :airplane:
A novoice's PyTorch implementation of [**FastSpeech 2: Fast and High-Quality End-to-End Text to Speech**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.04558) based on FastSpeech implementation of [**Deepest-Project FastSpeech**](https://github.com/Deepest-Project/FastSpeech).
The quality of voice samples generated by this repo is not upto mark, major reason being the use of `batch_size = 8` due to inferior GPU memory and processing power. With `batch_size>8` my CUDA memory ran out.
I would be glad if anyone reading this repo can take up the training with `batch_size` as given in the paper and/or suggest ways of improving the results. :innocent:

## For Demo  
Download the checkpoint from [here](). Place it in the `training_log` folder. And run the [inference.ipynb](./inference.ipynb). For mel to audio generation I have used MelGan from :flashlight: torch hub.  

## Requirements  
All code is writen in `python 3.6.10`.  
`requirements.txt` contains the list of all packages required to run this repo.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
